# AngularJS Webinar Source Code
#### Forked from [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)

This repo contains code from an [AngularJS Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGIyRI6Hwok) conducted for the Software Engineering course at the German University in Cairo. It is meant to be a starting point for making an angular app and is not a comprehensive tutorial.

### Running the code
Run ```npm start``` which autmatically runs ```npm install```, ```bower install``` and starts the server.
